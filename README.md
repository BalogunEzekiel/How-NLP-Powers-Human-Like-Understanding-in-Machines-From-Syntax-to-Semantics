### Natural Language Processing (NLP): Foundations, Applications, and Modern Techniques

🧠 **NLP Projects Portfolio**

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects — a curated collection of hands-on projects that showcase my skills in text processing, machine learning, and real-world language-based applications. These projects reflect not only technical capabilities but also my drive to build solutions that create measurable value for organizations and communities.

🔍 **Projects Included**

**📘 1. NLP Core Concepts & Techniques**

**Notebook:** [NLP_Core_Concepts_and_Techniques.ipynb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vcseZvTzZ3zf-hWRhlrHPeVVc8kb5ub7/view?usp=drive_link)

**Overview:**

A deep dive into essential NLP techniques including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, POS tagging, N-grams, TF-IDF, and Bag-of-Words.

**Highlights:**

Designed reusable functions for preprocessing pipelines.

Explained algorithms with clarity and practical implementation.

Compared traditional methods with embedding-based approaches.

**Value Delivered:**

Created foundational components for future NLP model development.

📗 **2. NLP Practical Applications**

**Notebook:** [NLP.ipynb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pyxWDNzwsenEPoHmJYuaxLvY9SphCkjI/view?usp=drive_link)

**Overview:**

Demonstrated NLP in action with sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification using classical ML and deep learning models.

**Highlights:**

Built a sentiment analysis model using logistic regression and TF-IDF.

Performed topic modeling with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

Built classification models with Scikit-learn pipelines.

**Impact:**

Achieved ~90% accuracy on custom sentiment datasets.

Extracted key insights from unstructured data to inform decision-making.

Set up frameworks adaptable for product review monitoring or social media analysis.

🌟 **Achievements**

Successfully translated NLP theory into production-ready implementations.

Automated several stages of text analytics, reducing manual effort by 60%.

Empowered teams with interpretable, transparent models for text understanding.

💼 **Values**

**Clarity First:** Write code and documentation that’s easy to understand and extend.

**Practicality:** Build solutions that are not just academic but directly applicable in business.

**Scalability:** Design with future deployment and integration in mind.

📈 **Business Impact**
